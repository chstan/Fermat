	When this gem is ready for production, you'll be able to find it on http://rubygems.org with a search for "Fermat". Once it's there, you can install it from the terminal via "gem install fermat".
	The name was chosen, though it may yet change, in reference to Pierre de Fermat, a 17th century French lawyer (and "amateur" mathematician) who made many contributions to algebraic number theory: in particular to what would become the theory of finite fields, analytic geometry, and the study of curves of genus 1.

	If you have any contributions to make, you can fork the project, or send me an email at chstan@stanford.edu. Unless there are specific contributions, it is likely that this library will grow merely to meet my own needs. All the same, there are a number of things that I would like to have in this library at some point. In no significant order:
		
		- Finite fields
		- Polynomials over a general field
		- Fast primality testing
			- AKS (just for fun)
			- Miller-Rabin
		- QR
			- Legendre and Jacobi symbols*
		- Cyclotomic polynomials
		- φ, τ, µ and all the other favorite elementary functions
		- Complete/Incomplete Gamma function
		- Sterling Numbers
